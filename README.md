# Tavernlight Software Developer Application

This is my application for the software developer position at Tavernlight Games.


## Trial
The test consists of 7 questions.

You can find the solutions for each of the questions in the links below. Each solution will have a README describing the situation and development process, as well as comments in the source code.

## Instructions

1. The files _client.zip and _server.zip contain the compiled files and necessary data to test the application.
2. In the _server.zip file, you will find the `/_server/tfs` directory and the `/_server/web` directory.
3. I used MAMP to host a local web server and recommend it if you don't have a preferred software.
4. After hosting the web server, import the file `/_server/tfs/libaniol_tavernlight_trial.sql` into the MySQL database (it will create the database, tables, account, and character).

>If you're interested in compiling TFS and Otclient, you can use the following repositories:
>
>[TFS](https://github.com/LeandroLibanio28H/forgottenserver/tree/1.4) (Branch - 1.4)
>[OTClient](https://github.com/LeandroLibanio28H/otclient) (Branch - Master)
>
>These repositories contain the changes implemented by me.
>
>
>If you choose to compile the project from these repositories, you still need to use the `/_server/tfs/data` directory and the `/_client/modules` directory to test the functionalities.
>
>The configuration files and the database can be copied from the provided directory. Otherwise, they should be configured manually to point to the correct IP and database.
>
>You can find more info on setting up TFS and OTclient [here](https://docs.otland.net/ots-guide/running-your-first-ot-server)

Following these steps, everything will be up and running, ready for testing. Just open the client and log in with the account "otserver" and password "otserver".
